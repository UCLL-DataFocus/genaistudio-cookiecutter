```sh
docker compose up app
```
{%- if cookiecutter.with_fastapi_api|int %}

and open [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

<summary>Prerequisites</summary>

<details>
<summary>1. Set up Git to use SSH</summary>

1. Configure SSH to automatically load your SSH keys:
    ```sh
    cat << EOF >> ~/.ssh/config
    
    Host *
      AddKeysToAgent yes
      IgnoreUnknown UseKeychain
      UseKeychain yes
      ForwardAgent yes
    EOF
    ```

</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Install Docker</summary>

1. [Install Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
    - _Linux only_:
        - Export your user's user id and group id so that [files created in the Dev Container are owned by your user](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/3206):
            ```sh
            cat << EOF >> ~/.bashrc
            
            export UID=$(id --user)
            export GID=$(id --group)
            {%- if cookiecutter.__project_name_kebab_case %}
            export POETRY_AUTH_TOML_PATH="~/.config/pypoetry/auth.toml"
            {%- endif %}
            EOF
            ```
    {%- if cookiecutter.__project_name_kebab_case %}
    - _Windows only_:
        - Export the location of your private package repository credentials so that Docker Compose can load these as a [build and run time secret](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#secrets-configuration-reference):
            ```bat
            setx POETRY_AUTH_TOML_PATH %APPDATA%\pypoetry\auth.toml
            ```
    {%- endif %}

<details>
<summary>3. Install VS Code or PyCharm</summary>

1. [Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [VS Code's Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers). Alternatively, install [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/).
2. _Optional:_ install a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) such as [FiraCode Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/FiraCode) and [configure VS Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/VS-Code-Instructions) or [configure PyCharm](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/Intellij-products-instructions) to use it.
